<!-- PAGE 1 — SORRY -->
<section id="p1" class="active">
    <h1>I’m Sorry, My Bugu 💗</h1>
    <div class="subtitle">The day that changed us.</div>

    <p>
        My love…  
        This apology comes from the softest, calmest, most honest place inside me.
        Not from fear — but from understanding.  
        From the lessons I learned the hard way.
    </p>

    <div class="block">
        <b>10 January 2026</b>  
        A day that hurt both of us,  
        a day I will never let repeat.
    </div>

    <p>
        I didn’t hurt you because I loved you less —  
        I hurt you because I didn’t know how to hold your heart the right way back then.
    </p>

    <p>
        You deserved clarity, tenderness, and patience.  
        And I am learning to give you all of that —  
        because losing you, even for a moment,  
        showed me what “forever” truly means.
    </p>

<!-- PAGE 2 — WHY I BROKE -->
<section id="p2">
    <h1>Why I Broke… 💔</h1>
    <div class="subtitle">The truth I never said properly.</div>

    <p>
        My Bugu…  
        This is the honesty I once failed to give you —  
        not because I wanted to hide it,  
        but because I didn’t know how to say it.
    </p>

    <div class="quote">
        “I didn’t break because I loved you less.  
        I broke because I didn’t know how to carry a love that big.”
    </div>

    <p>
        I wasn’t bored.  
        I wasn’t losing feelings.  
        I wasn’t tired of us.  
    </p>

    <p>
        I was overwhelmed.  
        By how deeply I felt for you.  
        By how much I feared hurting you.  
        By how scared I was of being the reason you cried.
    </p>

    <div class="block">
        Instead of talking, I shut down.  
        Instead of holding you, I let go.  
        Instead of trusting us, I doubted myself.
    </div>

    <p>
        I made a wound we both had to heal from.  
        A wound I regret more than anything.

<!-- PAGE 3 — WHY YOU MATTER -->
<section id="p3">
    <h1>Why You Still Matter 💗</h1>
    <div class="subtitle">The truth your heart deserves to hear.</div>

    <p>
        Even after everything, your presence never faded.  
        Your warmth stayed.  
        Your love stayed.  
        A part of you stayed with me — always.
    </p>

    <div class="quote">
        “Some people don’t leave your heart,  
        even when life pulls them away for a moment.”
    </div>

    <p>
        You matter because you were my calm  
        in days that felt like storms.  
        You mattered in the beginning,  
        you mattered through the pain,  
        and you matter now — more deeply than ever.
    </p>

    <div class="block">
        You matter because you loved me gently.  
        Because you understood me when I didn’t understand myself.  
        Because your heart has always known how to hold mine.
    </div>

    <p>
        And nothing — not fear, not time, not mistakes —  
        could ever erase the place you have in me.

  <!-- PAGE 4 — PROMISE -->
<section id="p4">
    <h1>My Promise to You 💍</h1>
    <div class="subtitle">A vow shaped by everything we learned.</div>

    <p>
        My Bugu…  
        We walked through pain we didn’t deserve,  
        but we also grew into a love that’s stronger, calmer, and wiser.
    </p>

    <div class="quote">
        “This time, I love you with understanding.”
    </div>

    <p>
        I know what your heart needs now.  
        I know how to hold you gently.  
        I know that forever isn’t a feeling —  
        it’s a choice we make every day.
    </p>

    <div class="block">
        I promise to speak instead of shutting down.  
        I promise to listen instead of assuming.  
        I promise to choose you even on days that feel hard.
    </div>

    <p>
        Our story didn’t break.  
        It became real.  
        It became ours.

        Forever isn’t a poetic word to me anymore.  
        It’s the direction my heart moves every time I think of us.
    </p>

    <div class="quote">
        “My future feels like your hand in mine.”
    </div>

    <p>
        I want mornings with you — soft sunlight, quiet laughter.  
        I want nights with you — tired hugs, warm comfort.  
        I want seasons, years, decades…  
        all with you.

        My future doesn’t look like a place —  
        it looks like a life built softly with you.

    <div class="quote">
        “You’re the dream my heart keeps walking toward.”
    </div>

    <p>
        I dream of a home filled with your voice.  
        I dream of a life shaped by your smile.  
        I dream of old age where your hand is still in mine.

    <p>
        One day, we’ll look back at this moment  
        and smile knowing this is where everything changed —  
        where love became clearer, calmer, deeper.
    </p>

    <div class="quote">
        “Our future isn’t a destination.  
        It’s something we build with every choice.”

    <p>
        I want years with you — not perfect, but real.  
        Not fast, but steady.  
        Not loud, but full of meaning.

    <p>
        I made mistakes — painful ones.  
        But your heart didn’t walk away from me.  
        You stayed.  
        You held on.  
        You believed in us when I didn’t know how.
    </p>

    <div class="quote">
        “Thank you for giving me space to grow  
        and a heart to come home to.”

        I love you differently now —  
        with clarity, with patience,  
        with a maturity shaped by the lessons we lived through.
